                <h3>Description</h3>
                <h4>A powered rail is a type of rail that is used to decrease or increase the 
                    momentum of moving minecarts. Powered rails can be crafted and previously-placed 
                    powered rails can be broken with bare hands or any tool, dropping themselves as 
                    items. To remove a powered rail, attack it. A powered rail can be used as a rail 
                    and as a redstone component, they can be powered by a redstone torch or lever.</h4>
